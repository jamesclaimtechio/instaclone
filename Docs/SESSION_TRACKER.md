## 📝 Session Log

### Session 1 - December 27, 2025

**Focus:** Module 1, Chunk 1.1 - Next.js App Initialization

**Goals:**
- [x] Initialize Next.js 15 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, App Router
- [x] Enable TypeScript strict mode
- [x] Create project directory structure
- [x] Setup environment variables foundation
- [x] Initialize git repository
- [x] Verify development environment works

**Progress:**
- ✅ Created SESSION_TRACKER.md to monitor progress
- ✅ Initialized Next.js 15 with React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, App Router
- ✅ Enhanced TypeScript with strict mode, strictNullChecks, and noUncheckedIndexedAccess
- ✅ Created directory structure: app/actions, components/ui, lib, db/migrations
- ✅ Setup .env.local and .env.example with all required environment variables
- ✅ Initialized git repository with proper .gitignore
- ✅ Verified dev server starts successfully on localhost:3000
- ✅ Verified production build completes without errors
- ✅ Made initial commits documenting setup

**Decisions Made:**
- Using pnpm as package manager (per .cursorrules requirement)
- App Router architecture (not Pages Router)
- React 19 required for useOptimistic hook support
- TypeScript strict mode for maximum type safety

**Blockers:** None

**Notes:**
- Successfully completed Chunk 1.1 in ~30 minutes
- React 19.2.3 installed (supports useOptimistic hook)
- Next.js 16.1.1 with Turbopack for fast dev experience
- All verification tests passed (dev server, production build, TypeScript compilation)
- Ready to proceed to Chunk 1.2 (Database Schema & Drizzle ORM)

## ✅ Completed Chunks

### Chunk 1.1 - Next.js App Initialization ✅
**Completed:** December 27, 2025  
**Duration:** ~30 minutes  
**Key Achievements:**
- Next.js 16.1.1 with React 19.2.3 initialized
- TypeScript strict mode enabled with enhanced null checks
- Project structure created (app/actions, components/ui, lib, db)
- Environment variables configured (.env.local, .env.example)
- Git repository initialized with proper commits
- Dev server verified working on localhost:3000
- Production build verified successful

**Challenges:** 
- Directory name "Instagram Clone" has spaces and capitals, not npm-compatible
- Workaround: Created in temp directory and moved files to root

**Learnings:**
- Next.js 16 uses Turbopack by default (faster than Webpack)
- React 19 is now stable and fully supported
- .env files blocked by .gitignore, used terminal commands instead

## 📌 Key Decisions Log

### Decision 1: Package Manager
**Chosen:** pnpm  
**Reason:** Required by .cursorrules for consistency  
**Alternative Considered:** npm, yarn  
**Impact:** All developers must use pnpm for this project

### Decision 2: App Router vs Pages Router
**Chosen:** App Router  
**Reason:** Next.js 15 default, required by module spec  
**Alternative Considered:** Pages Router (legacy)  
**Impact:** All routes live in app/ directory, Server Components by default

### Decision 3: React Version
**Chosen:** React 19  
**Reason:** Required for useOptimistic hook (critical for social features)  
**Alternative Considered:** React 18 (more stable)  
**Impact:** May encounter beta package issues, but needed for spec compliance
